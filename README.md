## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-tracking.git
   cd network-tracking
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install scapy pandas folium
Download and install Wireshark from wireshark.org.

Obtain your Google Maps API key from Google Cloud Console.

Usage
Capture network traffic using Wireshark and save it as a .pcap file.

Run the Python script to process the captured data:

bash
Copy code
python network_tracking.py --file path/to/your/file.pcap --api_key YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
The output will include a visual representation of the tracked network data on Google Maps.

Features
Capture and analyze network packets using Wireshark.
Visualize network traffic on an interactive Google Map.
Identify the geographical location of network sources and destinations.
Filter and process captured data using Python.
